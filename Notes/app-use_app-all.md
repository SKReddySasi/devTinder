### The difference between `app.use()` and `app.all()` in Express.

### Example 1: **Using `app.use()`**
`app.use()` is typically used to apply middleware globally or to a specific route, and it works for **all HTTP methods** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).

#### Example of `app.use()`:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// This middleware will run for every incoming request to the server
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`Request method: ${req.method} at ${req.url}`);
  next(); // Pass the request to the next handler
});

// Example route
app.get('/home', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Welcome to the Home page');
});

app.post('/home', (req, res) => {
  res.send('POST request to Home page');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

#### Output when you visit `/home`:
- The `app.use()` middleware will log the request method and URL first for both `GET` and `POST` requests, no matter which route or HTTP method you use. The message will look like this in the terminal:

```
Request method: GET at /home
Request method: POST at /home
```

In this case, `app.use()` runs for **all HTTP methods** and **all routes**.

---

### Example 2: **Using `app.all()`**
`app.all()` is used to handle **all HTTP methods** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) **for a specific route**.

#### Example of `app.all()`:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// This middleware will run for **all HTTP methods** on the '/example' route
app.all('/example', (req, res) => {
  res.send('This route handles all HTTP methods');
});

// Example routes with different methods
app.get('/example', (req, res) => {
  res.send('GET request to /example');
});

app.post('/example', (req, res) => {
  res.send('POST request to /example');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

#### Output when you visit `/example`:
- If you send a `GET` request to `/example`:
  ```
  GET request to /example
  ```
- If you send a `POST` request to `/example`:
  ```
  POST request to /example
  ```

- However, the `app.all('/example', ...)` will always run for **any HTTP method** on the `/example` route before the route-specific handlers (`GET`, `POST`, etc.). So, the output of visiting `/example` could be:

```
This route handles all HTTP methods
```

This will execute **before** the specific `GET` or `POST` handler because `app.all()` matches **all HTTP methods** for `/example`.

---

### Key Differences in Action:

- `**app.use()**` is **middleware** and runs for **every request** that comes to the server, no matter the route or HTTP method.
- `**app.all()**` is a **route handler** that runs for **all HTTP methods** on a specific route, no matter if it's a GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
